    "### ***Theory of GAs***\n",
    "\n",
    "The first appearance of genetic algorithms (GAs) was on J. D. Bagley's thesis *\"The behavior of adaptive systems which employ genetic and correlative algorithm\"*. He described them like this: *\"[...] genetic algorithms are simulations of evolution, of what kind ever. In most cases, however, genetic algorithms are nothing else than probabilistic optimization methods which are based on the principles of evolutions\"*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the problem GAs are used to solve is to find $x_\\in X$ such that an arbitrary $f:X \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is maximal, i.e. $f(x_0)=\\max_{x\\in X}f(x)$. Depending on the actual problem, it can be quite difficult to obtain such point and it might be sufficient to have a local maximum or to be as close as possible to the global maximum. The function $f$ is called *\"fitness\"* because it assigns values to individuals $x\\in X$ so that we can compare them. Reproduction and adaption are carried out at genetic information level, so GAs do not operate on the values of the search space $X$, but on some coded versions of them (like strings or arrays). \n",
    "\n",
    "Assume $S$ to be a set of strings (or arrays) in general with underlining grammar and let $X$ be the search space of the above optimization problem, then the function $c: X \\longrightarrow S$ is called a *coding function*; conversely $c^{-1}: S \\rightarrow X$ is called a *decoding function*.\n",
    "In practice, coding and decoding function have to be specified according to the needs of the actual problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transition from one generation to the next consists of four basic components:\n",
    "1. ***selection***: choose the individuals to be reproduced according to their fitness values.\n",
    "2. ***crossover***: merge the genetic information of two individuals (i.e. their chromosomes); if implemented correctly, good parents produce good children.\n",
    "3. ***mutation***: in GA, mutation is realized as a random deformation of the chromosomes arrays with a certain probability. The positive effects are the preservation of genetic diversity and avoiding of local maxima.\n",
    "4. ***sampling***: it's the procedure that computes a new generation from the previous one and its offsprings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: normal genetic algorithms do not use any auxiliary information about the objective function such as its gradient, so they can be applied to any kind of continuous or discrete optimization problem. Moreover, since they work on the whole population and not on a single point at time (like GD), they are more robust and have more chance to find the global optimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: the paper doesn't describe in depth all the parts of the algorithm and the design choices made; we have made them using what we learnt, maybe other choices could be more effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "The starting dataset is made of $F$ features, so $X$ will be the *power set* of $F$: $$X=\\mathcal{P}(F)=\\{A\\,|\\,A\\subseteq F\\}$$\n",
    "Chromosomes are represented as arrays of length $|F|$ ($b = \\{0, 1\\}^{|F|}$) where $i\\text{-th}$ gene represents wether feature $f_i$ is considered by the individual. Coding and decoding functions come naturally:\n",
